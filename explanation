Humidity or wind speed do not show any significant correlation with the latitude. Temperature looks like it's 
correlated with the latitude. When loking at the plots for Northern and Southern hemispheres separately it can be seen 
that the teperarture shows a statistically significant correlation with the latitude. But wind speed and humidity still do not 
show any significant correaltion.
